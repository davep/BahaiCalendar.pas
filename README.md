# BahaiCalendar.pas

BahaiCalendar.pas is some Delphi code I wrote for a friend who was working
on a [Baha'i](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_Faith)
calendar program. The core of the code is based on the Baha'i calendar
chapter of [Calendrical Calculations](http://www.calendarists.com/) (a book
that should be on the bookshelf of all programmers).

Please note that the authors of the book have requested that anyone wishing
to make "*commercial use*" of the code should seek their permission before
doing so. If you want to use BahaiCalendar.pas you can assume that you've
already got my permission (a credit in your application would be nice, but
that's up to you) but you *must* decide if you need to seek permission off
the authors of Calendrical Calculations. If in doubt, drop them a line.
